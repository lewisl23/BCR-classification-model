# Explainable machine learning classification for rheumatoid arthritis using B cell receptor sequences

This is the repository for the MSc Bioinformatics project dissertation:

## 1. airr_reads
- PRESTO analysis of Illumina raw reads
- IgBLAST analysis of quality controlled alligned reads
## 2. exploratory_and_data_cleaning
- Data cleaning and filtering
- Train test split
## 3. model_training
- logistic regression
- MLP sigmoid
- Unused MLP softmax and logistic regression (scikit-learn)
## 4. SHAP_analysis
- Analysis of feature importance in MLP model

## Note
Airr reads dataset is collected from "In Human Autoimmunity, a Substantial Component of the B Cell Repertoire Consists of Polyclonal, Barely Mutated IgG+ve B Cells" by Graeme Cowan. \
